# AtomOne Design Competition

## Create a Timeless Logo for the proposed AtomOne project

Are you a creative person with a passion for design? Can you craft a captivating logo that will stand the test of time? If so, we have the perfect task for you. In this design challenge, you’ll create a compelling logo for the proposed AtomOne project.

As a participant, you'll be able to showcase your artistic talent and compete for one of the 4 grand prizes, each in the amount of $7,000, meaning a total maximum prize pool of $28,000. All in Bits, as the organizer of this competition, reserves the right to select the winners in accordance with the outlined guidelines and requirements.

To ensure fairness and originality, we require all participants to create a unique logo distinct from any existing trademarked or in-use logos. Your design should genuinely reflect your creativity and innovation. 

As part of the competition, the winning participant agrees to waive his/her rights to the intellectual property of their design in favor of All in Bits (which may require execution of an IP transfer agreement, as determined by All in Bits). This will enable All in Bits to fully own and potentially utilize the logo or its variations to contribute to the development of the AtomOne potential future brand identity. 

All In Bits will only use the IP for the purpose of the proposed AtomOne project.
Are you ready to showcase your design prowess and make a lasting impact? Make sure you submit your application.
